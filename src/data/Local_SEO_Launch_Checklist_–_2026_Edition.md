## Website Structure & On-Page Essentials

- Put your **full physical address** (street, city, state, ZIP) in the **footer** of every page
- Make your **phone number** visible without scrolling (header / top bar / sticky CTA)
- **Front-load** your main keyword in the `<title>` / meta title tag
  Example: `Tree Removal Sacramento | Fast 24/7 Service | [Business Name]`
- Every important **H1** should contain the primary keyword + city
  Example: `Emergency Tree Removal in Sacramento`
- URL slugs must be descriptive / readable / keyword-inclusive
  Good: `/tree-removal-sacramento`
  Bad: `/post123`, `/services?id=47`
- **Never** build two pages targeting the same service + city keyword combo
  → Google usually ranks neither (cannibalization)
- Confirm the site is **indexed**
  → Search `site:yourdomain.com` in Google → fix in Search Console if missing
- Check for **404 errors** weekly (Google Search Console → Coverage report or crawler)

## Google Business Profile (GBP / GMB) Power Moves

- Link GBP to your **location / service-area page**, **not** the homepage
- Upload **at least one new photo** every single week (progress shots, team, vehicles, completed jobs, etc.)
- Reply to **every review** (good or bad) within **24 hours**
- Fill out the **Products** section completely — even for pure service businesses
  → Turn services into “products” with descriptions, photos, price ranges
- Match your **primary GBP category** to what the top 3 ranking competitors use
- Put your **main keyword + city** naturally in **every GBP post/update**

## Keyword & Content Strategy

- **Stop** writing generic blog posts if you're a local service business
  → Redirect that energy to service pages, location pages, reviews, before/afters
- Target **commercial intent** searches only: “**service + city**”
  Examples:
  - `tree removal sacramento`
  - `emergency plumber orange county`
  - `roof repair denver co`
  → Avoid “how to”, “what is”, “DIY” queries (browsers, not buyers)

## Citations & Directory Presence

- Create / claim / verify consistent NAP listings on:
  - Yelp
  - Better Business Bureau (BBB)
  - YellowPages
  - Uber (yes, they have business listings)
  - Local Chamber of Commerce
  - Other high-trust industry-specific directories
- Get verified on **Bing Places**
  → LLMs and some map/local results still pull heavily from Bing

## Reviews & Social Proof

- Ask **every single customer** for a Google review — make it systematic (text, email, QR code, post-service automation)

## Link Building (Safe & Effective)

- Send **80–90%** of your early backlinks to the **homepage**
- Use mostly **branded anchor text**
  Examples: `[Business Name]`, `visit [Business Name]`, `https://yourdomain.com`, `[Business Name] Sacramento`
  → Safest, most natural, and still very powerful

## The Brutal Truth

Most businesses fail because they half-do 4–5 of these items for 6 weeks and quit.

Do **every item** on this list **every month** for **6 straight months** → results compound dramatically.
